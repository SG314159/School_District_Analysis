# Module 4 | Assignment - PyCitySchools

Challenge 4 for UT Bootcamp.
Focus: Use Python and the Pandas library to analyze school district data and showcase trends in school performance.


## Overview of School District Analysis
The module exercises outlined the analysis of school and student performance for the math and reading tests. The analysis for the Challenge was to adjust the original analysis to not include the Thomas High School 9th graders. Per Challenge 4 instructions, the 9th grade math and reading scores were changed to NaN values and the analysis was redone. 

The original data set included scores for 39,170 students. The data set without THS 9th graders had 38,709. The difference of 461 students is 1.1% of the original data set.

## Results
- District Summary: The average math score for the district was slightly lower, at 78.9 down from 79.0. The average reading score for the district was the same (to one decimal place of precision) at 81.9. The percentages for each of these were also nearly identical to the entire data set (without THS 9th).
